## Exercise I

a)
O(n)

b)
O(log n)

for i in range(n) is tied to n. N gets bigger, so does the size
but as n gets bigger, j gets bigger at a slower rate
('j: ', 16)
('i: ', 5)
('j: ', 2)
('j: ', 4)
('j: ', 8)
('j: ', 16)
('i: ', 6)
('j: ', 2)
('j: ', 4)
('j: ', 8)
('j: ', 16)
('i: ', 7)
('j: ', 2)
('j: ', 4)
('j: ', 8)
('j: ', 16)
('i: ', 8)
('j: ', 2)
('j: ', 4)
('j: ', 8)
('j: ', 16)
('i: ', 9)
('j: ', 2)
('j: ', 4)
('j: ', 8)
('j: ', 16)


c)
O(c^n)
exponential
complexity grows greatly as input increases
recursion

I thought for a moment that this was actually linear. Size of input increases, so does complexity but at the same rate. But it can't handle larger inputs and it's recursive.
